# Technical test for finnovating

## Project to be carried out

* Create a Python/Django and PostgreSQL project.
* Create two related data models.
* Create endpoints to perform CRUD operations on both models with GraphQL.

Valuable:

* Comments in the code and a readme of use of the project.
* Dockerisation of the solution.


## Description

The project is a small API in Python/Django with graphene_django. It has 2 CRUDs for 2 data models (establishment and movie). 

The establishment table refers to the different establishments where cinemas are located.

The Movie table refers to the different movies playing inside each cinema. 

The data model auto-generated by dbeaver is as follows:

## Execution

To run the program, simply run the **deployment.sh** script and wait for the 2 docker services to mount.

To use the API, access the url `http://0.0.0.0:3003/graphql/` and start testing the different models provided.

**Important:** If using the script on windows, you will need to uncomment and replace a line of code found in the deployment.sh file due to a problem with naming containers in different O.S.
